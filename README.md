# Predict-Air-Pressure-System-Failures-and-minimize-costs-for-SCANIA-Trucks
This project was undertaken to predict failures and minimize costs based on sensor readings which has been extracted from heavy Scania trucks in everyday usage (Which can be in a way implied to forklift trucks sensors). By using Machine learning, different Supervised and Unsupervised methods were used in this project to find out the best accuracy so that the final model can be used for future use. Future predictions from the model are helpful in indicating whether a forklift needs to be serviced or not in order to avoid breaking down for the vehicle.
