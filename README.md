# Predict-Air-Pressure-System-Failures-and-minimize-costs-for-SCANIA-Trucks
This project was undertaken to predict failures and minimize costs based on sensor readings which has been extracted from heavy Scania trucks in everyday usage (Which can be in a way implied to forklift trucks sensors). By using Machine learning, different Supervised and Unsupervised methods were used in this project to find out the best accuracy so that the final model can be used for future use. Future predictions from the model are helpful in indicating whether a forklift needs to be serviced or not in order to avoid breaking down for the vehicle.
Methodology to be followed or approach: CRISP DM
Step 1: Descriptive statistics
Basic Descriptive statistics to understand the variables in the data set
•	Variability in data
•	Noise in the data
•	Data visualizations to understand variables distribution and correlation
Step 2: Preprocess the data 
•	Handle missing data
•	Removing any duplicates 
•	Data Transformation
•	Feature selection of variables
Step 3: Defining Validation Methods
•	Defining subset of data for model validation by defining
•	Cross validation and the evaluation metrics
•	Spot checking different linear and nonlinear ML algorithms
 Step 4: Accuracy Improvement
•	Algorithm Tuning for all algorithms which show a good accuracy
•	Compare Algorithms after Tuning
Step 5: Finalize Model
•	Tuned Model to make predictions on validation dataset
•	Save or Dumping the model
